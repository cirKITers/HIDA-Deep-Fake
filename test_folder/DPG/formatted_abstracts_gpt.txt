Title: Exploring artificial intelligence for engineered quantum matter
Authors: Eliska Greplova
Abstract: In research labs worldwide, quantum physics is making unprecedented strides. The realization of robust quantum systems holds tremendous promise for applications in secure communication and computing. Yet, as physicists, our most exciting pursuit lies in experimentally testing quantum phenomena predicted over the past century within highly controlled environments. In this talk, I will explore artificial intelligence approaches in the field of engineered quantum matter. Throughout the seminar, we will uncover how these approaches can be effectively deployed in contemporary quantum experiments. As one example, I will show how we can utilize generative models for parameter prediction of engineered topological systems known as Kitaev chains. Using this result and similar examples, I will discuss how we can use ML techniques to pave the way for advancing our control and understanding of real quantum experiments.

Title: Communicability as a criterion for interpretable representations
Authors: Renato Renner
Abstract: We propose an autoencoder architecture that can generate representations of data from physical experiments which are operationally meaningful and thus interpretable. The architecture is based on the paradigm of "communicability". Roughly, the idea is that the encoder orders the data into several parts that may be communicated separately to agents, whose task is to answer different questions about the data. The encoding is then optimised so that this communication is minimised, i.e., each agent receives precisely the information that is relevant to its task. Using some toy examples, including ones from quantum state tomography, we show that this approach leads to a separation of parameters, which can be regarded as a step towards interpretability.

Title: Disentangling Multiqubit States using Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Marin Bukov
Abstract: Quantum entanglement plays a central role in modern quantum technologies. It is widely perceived as a proxy for the quantum nature of physical processes and phenomena involving more than one particle. In this talk, we will revisit the problem of disentangling 4-, 5-, and 6-qubit quantum states with the help of machine learning techniques. We use policy gradient algorithms to train a deep reinforcement learning agent which, given access to the pure state of a multiqubit system, has to find the shortest sequence of disentangling two-qubit gates that brings it to a product state. We leverage the agent's interpolation and extrapolation capabilities to learn (approximately) optimal strategies to disentangle Haar-random states that lack any obvious spatial entanglement structure in the computational basis. Analyzing the protocols found by the agent, we show that any 4-qubit state can be prepared using at most 11 CNOT gates. Last, we also demonstrate the robustness of our agent to various sources of stochasticity common for present-day NISQ devices.

Title: Neural Quantum States For The Many-Electron Problem
Authors: Giuseppe Carleo
Abstract: This presentation explores recent strides in using neural quantum states [1] to represent many-body fermionic quantum wave functions for the many-electron problem [2]. I will delve into a message-passing-neural-network-based Ansatz designed for simulating strongly interacting electrons in continuous space [3]. This approach achieves unprecedented accuracy in the electron gas problem, pushing the boundaries of system sizes previously inaccessible to neural network states. I will also discuss a Pfaffian-based neural-network quantum state for ultra-cold Fermi gases, outperforming traditional methods and enabling exploration of the BCS-BEC crossover region [4]. Finally, I will provide insight into ongoing work on the entanglement properties of Helium 4 and Helium 3, and discuss open problems in the field [5].

Title: Neural quantum states for strongly correlated systems: learning from data and Hamiltonians

Abstract: Neural quantum states have emerged as a new tool to efficiently represent quantum many-body states with two main use cases: 1.) efficiently reconstruct a quantum state by training on measured data. For states with a non-trivial sign structure, measurements in many different basis configurations are necessary. I will present an active learning scheme which adaptively chooses the next measurement basis in order to maximize the information gain. 2.) The second main application of neural quantum states is to apply variational Monte Carlo to find e.g. the ground state of a system. I will present some of our recent results on ground states of strongly correlated systems, such as t-J type systems and fractional quantum Hall states. Finally, we combine both approaches: by first training on experimental data from a Rydberg atom tweezer array, we initialize the neural quantum state closer to the ground state. By then switching to variational Monte Carlo to minimize the energy in the second stage of training, we find a speedup in convergence. This showcases how limited datasets from experiments can be combined with numerical methods in a hybrid approach to yield more accurate results than either could provide on their own.

Title: Towards an Artificial Muse for new Ideas in Quantum Physics
Authors: Mario Krenn
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a potentially disruptive tool for physics and science in general. One crucial question is how this technology can contribute at a conceptual level to help acquire new scientific understanding or inspire new surprising ideas. I will talk about how AI can be used as an artificial muse in quantum physics, which suggests surprising and unconventional ideas and techniques that the human scientist can interpret, understand and generalize to its fullest potential.
